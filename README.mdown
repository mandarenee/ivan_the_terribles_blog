# Ivan the Terrible's Blog!

Ivan the Terrible designed a blog that shows EVERYTHING on the front page of the site! It was pretty slow, so I worked to make it a little quicker while preserving all of the content on the front of the page.

When I originally opened the document, it was taking 70-80 seconds to load the page locally. Heroku wouldn't have any of it and timed out every time.
